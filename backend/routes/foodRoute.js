// ðŸ”¹ Q1. What is the purpose of multer in this router?
// Answer:
// multer handles image uploads by saving files to the uploads folder.
// It uses a disk storage engine to name files uniquely with timestamps.

// ðŸ”¹ Q2. How is the uploaded image accessed in the controller?
// Answer:
// The uploaded file is accessed via req.file.filename.
// This filename is then saved to the database for later use.

// ðŸ”¹ Q3. What does the route /add do?
// Answer:
// It handles POST requests to add a new food item with an image.
// It uses upload.single("image") middleware before calling addFood.

// ðŸ”¹ Q4. Why is the filename prefixed with Date.now()?
// Answer:
// It ensures uniqueness by avoiding name clashes for uploaded files.
// This helps prevent overwriting files with the same original name.

// ðŸ”¹ Q5. How can this file upload mechanism be improved?
// Answer:
// Use MIME type validation and size limits in multer for security.
// Optionally, integrate with cloud storage like Cloudinary or S3.

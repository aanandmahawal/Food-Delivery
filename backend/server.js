// ðŸ”¹ Q1. What is the purpose of this file?
// Answer:
// It initializes the Express server, connects to MongoDB, sets up middleware, and mounts API routes.
// This file serves as the entry point of the backend application.

// ðŸ”¹ Q2. How is CORS configured and why is it important?
// Answer:
// CORS is configured to allow requests from your frontend domain with credentials.
// It prevents cross-origin errors when the frontend communicates with the backend.

// ðŸ”¹ Q3. What does app.use("/images", express.static('uploads')) do?
// Answer:
// It serves uploaded image files as static content under the /images path.
// This allows frontend access to food images stored on the server.

// ðŸ”¹ Q4. How are routes organized in this file?
// Answer:
// All routes are modularized into separate routers (food, user, cart, order).
// Each is mounted under a common API path like /api/food.

// ðŸ”¹ Q5. What happens when you visit the base URL (/)?
// Answer:
// The server responds with "API Working" as a simple health check.
// This confirms that the backend server is running.

// ðŸ”¹ Q6. How is the server port set and made flexible?
// Answer:
// It reads the port from process.env.PORT, or defaults to 4000.
// This allows flexibility across local and production environments.
